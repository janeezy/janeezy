My name is Jane Duru, and I am a self-taught front-end engineer who is ready to make an impact. With less than a year of experience, I have achieved a lot and am hungry for more opportunities to develop my programming skills.

I am more interested in hands-on training than just theory. My ability to learn quickly and adapt to new technologies will enable me to excel in any environment. I can guarantee you that if you give me a chance, you won't regret it. I am a hardworking, reliable individual who is committed to delivering high-quality results.

As a Front-end engineer, I'm passionate about growth and contributing to larger development teams, as well as taking on exciting freelance projects. 

With my expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and contemporary libraries/frameworks, I am adept at creating and maintaining responsive websites. 

I am always eager to tackle new challenges and maximize user efficiency through innovative solutions and process optimization. Let's work together to bring your project to the next level!
