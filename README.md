꧁⭑⭒ 

My name is Jane Duru, and I am a self-taught front-end engineer who is ready to make an impact. With less than a year of experience, I have achieved a lot and am hungry for more opportunities to develop my programming skills.

I am more interested in hands-on training than just theory. My ability to learn quickly and adapt to new technologies will enable me to excel in any environment. I can guarantee you that if you give me a chance, you won't regret it. I am a hardworking, reliable individual who is committed to delivering high-quality results.

I am passionate about working in a larger development team that tackles challenging tasks and strives to improve user efficiency. My excellent organizational skills and positive attitude will enable me to successfully manage multiple priorities and work towards team goals. I am willing to take on additional responsibilities to help our team achieve success.

I encourage you to take a look at my portfolio at https://janeduru.com. I am confident that I have the skills and qualifications necessary to be an asset to your organization.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
